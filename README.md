Interactive Dashboard for Microbes in Human Navels

This dashboard incorporates multiple charts/graphs to allow users to exam the data from a belly button biodiversity study.  The page
loads the charts/graphs with information from the first sample id and then the user can select another sample id.  The page reloads with
updated data from the selected sample.

Charts/graph components:
1.) Horizontal Bar Chart - displays top 10 microbial species (aka OTUs/Operational Taxonomic Units) for the individual 
2.) Bubble Chart - displays all samples for the individual
3.) Gauge Chart - washing frequency for the individual
 
The technical contents (files) used in development of this dashboard are:
1.) The Static/js folder with the js application.
2.) The CSS was already available, no modifications were needed.
3.) The index html file, no updates were needed. 
4.) The data source is the samples.json file.
